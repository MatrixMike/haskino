# Haskino

Haskino (Haskell Arduino) is our framework for exploring EDSL concepts with the Arduino.

The current version, 0.6, is a new version using a GHC plugin which allows
a Shallow DSL program to be automatically rewritten to a Deep DSL.
This is necessitated changing some of Haskino's Deep API's, and renaming
others.  The last version is still availalbe at the v0.5 tag.
